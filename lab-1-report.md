## Lab 1

![Image 1](assets/Lab1-1)
1) Changes directory to the home directory, not an error
2) Changes directory to lecture1, not an error
3) Does not change directory as the parameter is not a directory, error because you cannot use a file as a directory

![Image 2](assets/Lab1-2)
1) Not sure exactly what is happening, I think it is opening a iostream from the terminal and reprints the input on enter, not necessarily an error
2) Does not print anything, error because you cannot print the “contents” of a directory.
3) Prints out the entire file, not an error.

![Image 3](assets/Lab1-3)
1) Lists the current directory, not an error
2) Lists the contents of the parameter directory, not an error
3) Prints the directory of the parameter directory, not an error
